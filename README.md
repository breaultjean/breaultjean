Hi üëã, I'm sort of an electrical engineer? I mean I studied that and got rapidly involved in embedded software and hardware development but drifted to develop a bit of everything else around the stack, the cloud, web and a lot of dotnet (C#). 

So I don't know how to define that anymore, Full Stack IoT developer? Buzz words, buzz words... 

I have many years of experience, focused on the best practices:
- by proposing security analysis (threat modelling, secure as design, etc.)
- by developping the proper tests (unit, integration, QA plans)
- by automating processes as much as I can (IaC, Kubernetes, etc.)
- by documenting when needed.

For me, my team is the most important thing. I also always work to make the best of myself, improve, etc.

I'm interested in many things, but my main goal is to get back to embedded design these days. I worked in the cloud for many years and I need to get back to the bread boards.

I'm currently learning this kubernetes docker thing... is this just a fad? We'll see!

I'm looking to collaborate outside of my business hours on different open source projects, feel free to reach if you need anything or want to start working on something around:
- Politics platform to promote municipal elections. *To me, Democracy is not at its best with the 30-ish % of participation in Quebec in the last municipal election.*
- IoT and embedded.
- Anything agricultural, I co-launched 
- Anything Manufacturing 4.0. I worked a lot in my previous position to automate whole manufacturing processes and I really enjoyed making it more efficient and less error prone.

I'm presently working for Uzinakod Inc, a Montreal based company that focuses on Software and Cloud Solutions, Digital transformation, IoT and Industry 4.0 and Artificial Intelligence.

At night and during the weekends, don't look for me, I'm probably in the barn feeding our hens or in the field planting stuff... I'm also starting Alectryon Software to present innovative embedded and cloud solutions in AgTech.

And you can reach me by email `JS [at] BREAU [dot] LT`

Can't believe someone would read all of that, here's a cookie üç™.
