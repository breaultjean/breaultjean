Hi üëã, I'm sort of an electrical engineer? I mean I studied that and got rapidly involved in embedded software and hardware development but drifted to develop a bit of everything else around the stack, the cloud, web and a lot of C#. 

So I don't know how to define that anymore, Full Stack IoT developer? Buzz words, buzz words... 

I have many years of experience, focused on the best practices:
- by proposing security analysis (threat modelling Johny!)
- by developping the proper tests
- by automating processes as much as I can (IaC Baby!)
- by documenting when needed.

For me team is upmost important than technologies. I always work to make the best of myself.

I'm interested in many things, but my main goal is to get back to embedded design these days. I worked in the cloud for many years and I need to get back to the bread boards.

I'm currently learning Rust and this kubernetes docker thing...

I'm looking to collaborate outside of my business hours on different projects, feel free to reach if you need anything or want to start working on something around:
- Politics platform to promote municipal elections and platforms. *To me, Democracy is not at its best with the 30-ish % of participation in Quebec in the last municipal election.*
- IoT and Home automation (Home Assistant and the like)
- Anything agricultural, I tried to start a business around Ag Techn last year with no success, but I'm still very interested in that field
- Anything Manufacturing 4.0. I worked a lot in my previous position to automate a whole manufacturing process and I really enjoyed making it more efficient and less error prone.

I'm working for Uzinakod Inc, a Montreal based company that focuses on Software and Cloud Solutions, Digital transformation, IoT and Industry 4.0, Artificial Intelligence and Communication Strategies. We have opened positions, don't hesitate to reach us.

And you can reach me on twitter `@breaultjean` and by email `JS [at] BREAU [dot] LT`

Can't believe someon would read all of that, here's a cookie üç™.
